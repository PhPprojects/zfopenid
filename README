This is an example Zend Framework 1.11.3 application that uses OpenID (Google,
Yahoo, MyOpenId, AOL, OpenId) as well as Facebook Connect and Twitter Oauth for
authorization of users.

To make it all work I used the following elements:
 - openid-selector
 - My_Auth_Adapter_Facebook by Michael Krotscheck
 - My_Auth_Adapter_Oauth and My_Auth_Adapter_Oauth_Twitter by Jason Austin
 - My_OpenId_Extension_AttributeExchange by Chris Bisnett
 - Patched Zend_OpenId_Constumer (http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6905)

In some cases I made slight modifications to the above elements.


INSTALATION
===========

The application contains everything that it needs to run, including full
Zend Framework 1.11.3 (with patched  Zend_OpenId_Constumer). The exceptions are Facebook and Twitter app keys that need to
be included in appkeys.ini. Normally, Facebook and Twitter require every application that uses their API to be 
registered with them. Once an application is registered,  a user gets app id and a secret key. When you have this keys 
you need to make an appkeys.ini file ( appkeys_example.ini example provided) with your own keys.

Zend_Auth_Adapter_OpenId uses file based storage. For this reason, the application
must be able to create, write and read APPLICATION_PATH . '/../tmp' folder.
