README
======

This is an example Zend Framework 1.11.3 application that uses OpenID (Google,
Yahoo, MyOpenId, AOL, OpenId) as well as Facebook Connect and Twitter Oauth for
authorization of users.

To make it all work I used the following elements:
 - openid-selector
 - My_Auth_Adapter_Facebook by Michael Krotscheck
 - My_Auth_Adapter_Oauth and My_Auth_Adapter_Oauth_Twitter by Jason Austin
 - My_OpenId_Extension_AttributeExchange by Chris Bisnett
 - Patched Zend_OpenId_Custumer (http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6905)

In some cases I made slight modifications to the above elements.


INSTALATION
===========

The application contains everything that it needs to run,including full
Zend Framework 1.11.3. The exceptions are Facebook and Twitter app keys that need to
be included in appkeys.ini. You need to register your copy of this application
with Facebook and Twitter and obtain the keys.

Zend_Auth_Adapter_OpenId uses file based storage. For this reason, the application
must be able to create, write and read APPLICATION_PATH . '/../tmp' folder.
